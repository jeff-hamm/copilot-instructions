# Git Workflow
Use this prompt when I ask you to use or work with a copilot branch.
- Write commit messages that explain what changed and why
- Before working on a copilot branch, check whether `<current branch>_copilot` exists; create it if it does not
- Use `git worktree` when I ask you to commit to a copilot branch; otherwise use the current branch
